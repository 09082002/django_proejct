            <h1 class="h1" >Nur-Sultan Arts & Culture</h1>

            <p style="width: 700px; margin-top: 30px; font-size: 18px;">Nur-Sultan is a city on the rise – literally and figuratively. Its stunning modern architecture is rising from the vast Asian steppe as its international reputation as a center of regional trade and politics grows along side. The same is true
                of the city’s arts culture. The venues and the art you will find here reflect the history of Kazakhstan while pushing the boundaries of what came before.</p>
